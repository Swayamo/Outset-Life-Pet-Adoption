# Outset Life - Pet Adoption 🐾

Welcome to **Outset Life - Pet Adoption** — my very first web development project! 🚀

## 📌 About

This project was built while I was just getting started with web development. Everything is hard-coded — no frameworks, no backend — just raw HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It was a way for me to **experiment**, **explore**, and **understand** how things work on the web.

## 💡 What I Learned

- Basic HTML structure and semantics
- CSS styling and layout
- JavaScript for simple interactions
- Organizing files in a project
- How to use Git and GitHub for version control

## 🚧 Disclaimer

This project is not responsive or production-ready. It's purely experimental and created as a **learning milestone**. Improvements and rewrites will follow as I learn more.

## 📁 Tech Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (Vanilla)

## 🌱 Future Plans

- Make it responsive
- Add backend support (maybe Node.js or Firebase)
- Improve design and accessibility
- Learn React or Vue and rebuild this from scratch

## 🙌 Acknowledgements

Thanks to all the online tutorials that helped me figure things out.
